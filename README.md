<h1 align="center">taskr</h1>

The simplest to install and use agile board (CLI and Web)

Just run
```bash
taskr init
```
To init the project in the current directory

And then
```bash
taskr backlog --task "Add more cool features ðŸ˜ƒ"
```


## Usage

The first step is to initialise a new project using tarkr. To do so, run in the current directory:

```bash
taskr init
```

This will create a ```taskr.json``` file in the current directory. All the future operations need to be run from the directory where this file resides. You can add this file to the versioning to enable tracking of the tasks and work across multiple environments.

In taskr tasks have four different sections:
1. Backlog
2. Selected for development
3. In progress
4. Done

When adding new tasks they are automatically added to the backlog. When the tasks are **moved** they follow the pipeline:
```
Backlog -> Selected for development -> In progress -> Done
```

To add a new task use

```bash
taskr backlog --task "My awesome task"
```

Optionally you may add ```--deadline``` option to track the finishing time for the task.

To list all the tasks run:

```bash
taskr tasks
```

This will output:
```bash
 BACKLOG               SELECTED FOR DEVELOPMENT  IN PROGRESS  DONE                     
 ---inspiring_buck---                                          ---blissful_ramanujan--- 
 My awesome task                                              Cool                     
                                                              ---trusting_bassi---     
                                                              Work on projects              
```

When you want your task to move across the pipeline take the id of the task (---blissful_ramanujan) and run:
```bash
taskr mv --task inspiring_buck
```

This will output:
```bash
 BACKLOG  SELECTED FOR DEVELOPMENT  IN PROGRESS  DONE                     
          ---inspiring_buck---                   ---blissful_ramanujan--- 
          My awesome task                        Cool                     
                                                 ---trusting_bassi---     
                                                 Work on projects         
```
